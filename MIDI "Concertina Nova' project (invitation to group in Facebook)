Our Facebook group, Concertina Technology, is following the (MIDI ) Concertina Nova project.

English-type concertina for a start, but other types later if things go as hoped.

That group is at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1771580879534725/?ref=group_browse_new 

We're hoping to have a prototype within a few months (2Q 2019) if the builder has spare time to do the work. He's busy with s house move and his job at the moment.

The design specification aims to produce a totally self-contained (wireless, with battery and speakers contained in it) but with USB socket for loading with any desired .WAV sounds) 

It's not a commercial product, just a collaboration between me (Bruce Thomson, concept and specifications) and the technologist (Nguyenvy Ngo in Vietnam)

Hoping the price of it will be about $US450.

You/anyone interested, can join the group at the link above.

I had a look at your MIDI concertina on YouTube - interesting, fun.

I lived in Montreal ten years, so have some French sympathies. =)
